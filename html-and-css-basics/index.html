         This can take long if the file is large which is very common in modern
         applications.

         With the `async` attribute, we can tell browser to execute a
         javascript file without blocking the render of the rest of the html or
         blocking the executing of other javascript.

         With the `defer` attribute, we can tell the browser to execute a file
         in order and only once the entire document is rendered.
